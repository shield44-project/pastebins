## GitHub Pages Deployment

### 🌐 Live Demo
Visit the live demo at: **https://shield44-project.github.io/codes_storer_website/**

The GitHub Pages deployment includes:
- A landing page explaining the project and features
- The encrypted file viewer (`viewer.html`) as a standalone static page

### ⚠️ Important Limitations
**This is primarily a Flask application that requires a Python backend server.** GitHub Pages only supports static HTML/CSS/JavaScript files and **cannot run the full application** with the following features:
- Code execution (Python, Java, C, C++)
- Code storage and upload
- File management

To use these features, you must run the application locally (see installation instructions below).

### What Works on GitHub Pages
- ✅ Project landing page with documentation
- ✅ Encrypted file viewer (requires separate decryption server)
- ✅ Static content and documentation

## Installation (Local Deployment)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- For code execution support, install:
  - Python 3 (for Python code execution)
  - Java JDK (for Java code execution)
  - GCC (for C code execution)
  - G++ (for C++ code execution)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shield44-project/codes_storer_website.git
cd codes_storer_website
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Running with Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

## Usage Guide

### Uploading Code

**Single File Upload (Paste Code):**
1. Click on "Upload New Code" button on the home page
2. Select the "📝 Paste Code" tab
3. Select the language (Python, Java, C, C++, or HTML)
4. Enter a title for your code
5. Optionally add a description
6. Paste your code in the code editor
7. Click "Upload Code"

**Multiple File Upload:**
1. Click on "Upload New Code" button on the home page
2. Select the "📁 Upload Files" tab
3. Select the language
4. Click "Select Files" and choose one or more files
5. Preview the selected files
6. Click "Upload Files"

### Viewing Encrypted Python Code Examples

The repository includes encrypted Python code examples that can be viewed securely:

1. Navigate to `/encrypted-viewer` on the running Flask app
2. Select a Python file from the list of encrypted files
3. Get an access token (automatically generated for 1 hour)
4. Paste the token in the "Access Token" field
5. Click "🔓 Decrypt & View" to see the decrypted code

**Note:** The private key required for decryption must be present on the server (`private_key.pem`). The encrypted code examples are stored in the `encrypted/` directory and can only be viewed through the secure web interface with valid authentication tokens.

### Viewing and Executing Code

**For Programming Languages (Python, Java, C, C++):**
1. Navigate to a language category from the home page
2. Click on a code file to view it
3. Click "▶️ Run Code" to execute the code
4. Optionally provide input in the "Input (stdin)" field
5. View the output in the output panel

**For HTML Websites:**
1. Navigate to the HTML category
2. Click on an HTML file to view it
3. The left panel shows the HTML code
4. The right panel shows a **live preview of the website running**
5. Use the "🔄 Refresh" button to reload the preview
6. Use the "⛶ Fullscreen" button to view the website in fullscreen mode
7. Use the "📋 Copy Code" button to copy the HTML code

### Category Management

All uploaded files are automatically organized by language:
- Python files → Python category
- Java files → Java category
- C files → C category
- C++ files → C++ category
- HTML files → HTML category

## Security Features

### Code Execution Security
- Code execution is sandboxed with 5-second timeout limits
- Temporary directory usage for compilation and execution
- Input sanitization for uploaded code
- HTML preview uses iframe with sandbox attributes
- No direct file system access from executed code
- Command injection prevention with shell=False

### Encrypted Code Storage
- **Hybrid RSA-4096 + AES-256-GCM encryption** for Python code examples
- **Server-side decryption only** - private key never exposed to clients
- **Token-based authentication** with HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- **Time-limited access tokens** (default 1 hour, configurable)
- Encrypted files stored in repository, safe to commit
- Private key must be kept secure on server (excluded from git)
- See [ENCRYPTION_README.md](ENCRYPTION_README.md) for detailed documentation

### File Upload Security
