# Sample Code Files

This directory contains sample code files, compiled executables, and other example files used for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Contents

### Organized Examples (`organized/`)

The `organized/` subdirectory contains well-structured sample code organized by programming language:
- **Python** - Python code examples (algorithms, data structures, file handling, etc.)
- **C** - C programming examples (pointers, arrays, functions, etc.)
- **C++** - C++ programming examples (OOP, templates, etc.)
- **HTML** - HTML/CSS examples (layouts, responsive design, etc.)

See [organized/README.md](organized/README.md) for more details.

### Other Files

This directory also contains:
- Compiled C/C++ executables (binary files) used for testing
- Sample text files and data files
- PNG images and other assets

## Purpose

These files serve several purposes:
1. **Testing** - Used to test the code execution features of the application
2. **Examples** - Demonstrate various programming concepts
3. **Reference** - Provide code snippets for learning

## Note on Structure

This directory is separate from:
- **`templates/`** - Contains Flask HTML templates (Jinja2) for the web application
- **`stored_codes/`** - Contains user-uploaded code files (not committed to repository)
- **`encrypted/`** - Contains encrypted Python code examples with token-based access
- **`static/`** - Contains CSS, JavaScript, and other web assets

## Usage

The files in this directory are committed to the repository and can be used for:
- Testing the application's code execution capabilities
- Learning programming concepts
- Reference when creating new code files
