3. Sample code for testing the application's code execution features
4. Templates for new projects

## Location

These sample code files are stored in the `sample_codes/organized/` directory, separate from:
- Flask HTML templates (in `templates/`)
- User-uploaded code files (in `stored_codes/`)
- Encrypted code examples (in `encrypted/`)

## Encryption

Code files in this directory can be encrypted using the encryption tools provided in the root directory. Encrypted versions are stored separately in the `encrypted/` directory.
